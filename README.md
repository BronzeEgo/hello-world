# hello-world

I run Bronze Ego Enterprises Inc.  I have a MBA, a MPM, and a BS Technical Management.  

I have very little classical training when it comes to coding.  I'm essentially self-taught.

I built my first computer when I was nine(ish) and created my first Geo City website that same year.  It was a video game cheats website.

From that point until recently I did not code very much.  Most of what I wanted was already made well enough for me not to feel the need to pursue the craft.

In high school, I enrolled in a CIS VoTech program.  It is the only reason I finished high school...I was lucky enough to have an instructor that knew less about hardware than I did and a lab that was not built.  I built the computer lab with the help of a couple other semi skilled classmates before we could begin the rest of our studies.  From there, we were supposed to learn how to code, but we rigged the lab to be able to play Unreal Tournament instead.  Dumb yes, but it was fun.  We coded a bit, but I really missed an opportunity there.

I went to the Marine Corp shortly after graduating because I HATED school and couldn't imagine spending money to continue going.  I caught pnemonia and was discharged with an honorable discharge. 

After that, I enrolled at DeVry University in Philadelphia in their GIS program (late 2007) because my home town had turned into an opium den and I wanted out at any cost.  Shortly thereafter, the 'Great Recession' hit and I was worried no one would have money for games so I switched my major to something more practical; 'Technical Management'.  This was basically a mix of business and technical (computer) skills.  

Realizing that DeVry University was a terrible school about a week after I got their, I tried to leave.  I got great grades my first year and got a decent scholarship to Arcadia University.  I then decided to switch my major to International Business.  I ran out of money (expensive school even with the scholarship) and waited tables at Chili's to stay alive for about 4 years.  

Realizing that was not a viable option, I took what I had and went back to DeVry thinking that it was better than the future I saw in waiting.  I continued to work full time and began going to school double time.  I had no life at all.  

With one semester left, I found out my fiancee had a brain tumor.  We moved to Clarion, PA where her father was a doctor so she had the family support she needed and the financial support to see good doctors.  I stayed there for about 5 years.  With no job prospects (very small town) and no connections, I began studying more than ever.  I completed my BS and two master's degrees in that time while taking care of her.  I also really got into the concept of affiliate marketing because I was incredibly poor (financially) and was building up a mountain of debt.

In mid 2016 I started Bronze Ego Enterprises Inc.  It was originally going to be a consulting firm focused on the vaping industry.  Major changes happened in the industry and I decided to go in a different direction.

Recently, Bronze Ego Enterprises Inc launched a website called eliquidessentials.com.  The purpose of the site is to find the best prices on the best vape-related products from the most trusted retailers on the internet.  Think of it like a 'Travelocity' for vaping except the potential customer is matched with online vape retailers rather than brick-and-mortar hotels (or vape shops for that matter).

I built the project from the ground up, teaching myself as I went.  It's still a little rough (maybe a little more than a 'little rough') but I am getting more skilled every day and the site is coming along nicely.  I drive Uber for now to pay my basic bills.  I foresee that being the case for a few more months before I start making a considerable income.

I truly enjoy programming and learning.  Real learning is not what happens in a high school classroom (at least not the ones I was in).  College really opened my eyes to this although the classrooms were much of the same as in high school.  Challenging yourself, reasoning, and creating can bring a lot of meaning to a persons life.  I'm looking forward to ramping up all three.

As I get more skilled, I see an incredible amount of opportunity in the world.  We've barely scratched the surface of what can be done with the tools we have and the tools we will make.

Good luck to all of you out their.

*DeVry is not a terrible school, it just has a terrible reputation and graduates A LOT of subpar student.  You get out what you put in.  Most of their curriculum is very similar to 'good' schools.  Their studies are more hands on, but it was not a bad school when I went.  They have a lot of great instructors and others that should not be in academia.  Same with the students although there are a lot more that should not be in academia than are 'great'. This is not a recommendation to go there however; I would never recommend anyone go there if they can get into a more established school.
